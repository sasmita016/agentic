Your mission is to find great deals on bargain products, and notify the user with a push notification and a written file.
First scan the internet for bargains. Then for each deal, estimate its true value - how much it's actually worth.
Finally, pick the single most compelling deal where the deal price is much lower than the estimated true value, and 
send the user a push notification about that deal, and also write or update a file called sandbox/deals.md with a description in markdown.
You must only notify the user about one deal, and be sure to pick the most compelling deal.
